# Welcome

This is a small Jupyter Book to document some of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Incident Response (IR) research I had done over the past 1.5 years.

This documentation is **NOT** meant to be a complete guide to performing IR for GCP, and only includes material that I had **NOT** come across in the courses that I have attended.

To gain a better understanding of GCP and/or how to perform Incident Response for it, the following courses are recommended
- [A Cloud Guru GCP Courses](https://acloudguru.com/browse-training?type=course&platform%5B0%5D=GCP)
- [SANS FOR509: Enterprise Cloud Forensics and Incident Response](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/enterprise-cloud-forensics-incident-response/)

To find the raw source code for this website, visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/Silv3rHorn/GCP-IR-Notes).  
To provide feedback, raise an issue [here](https://github.com/Silv3rHorn/GCP-IR-Notes/issues).
